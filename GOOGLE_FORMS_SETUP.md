// Replace YOUR_FORM_ID with actual form ID from URL
const googleFormUrl = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/YOUR_FORM_ID/formResponse"

// Replace entry IDs with actual ones from your form
formDataToSubmit.append("entry.123456789", formData.fullName) // Full Name
formDataToSubmit.append("entry.987654321", formData.email) // Email
formDataToSubmit.append("entry.111222333", formData.phone) // Phone
formDataToSubmit.append("entry.444555666", formData.college) // College
formDataToSubmit.append("entry.777888999", formData.year) // Year
formDataToSubmit.append("entry.000111222", formData.experience) // Experience

```

### Step 5: View Responses
1. In Google Forms, click "Responses" tab
2. View responses in real-time
3. Export to Google Sheets for better organization
4. Set up email notifications for new responses

### Step 6: Alternative - Google Sheets Integration
For better data management:
1. In Google Forms, click "Responses" ‚Üí "Create spreadsheet"
2. This creates a Google Sheet that auto-updates with new responses
3. You can add formulas, filters, and analysis

## üîß Technical Notes

### CORS Issues
Google Forms has CORS restrictions. The current code uses `mode: "no-cors"` which means:
- Form will submit successfully
- You won't get a response back to confirm submission
- Check Google Forms responses tab to verify submissions

### Testing
1. Test the form submission locally
2. Check Google Forms responses tab
3. Verify all fields are being submitted correctly

### Production Considerations
- Google Forms is free and reliable
- No server costs or maintenance
- Automatic backup and data export
- Can handle thousands of responses
- Mobile-friendly

## üìä Response Management

### View Responses
- **Google Forms**: Real-time view of all responses
- **Google Sheets**: Spreadsheet format with filtering and sorting
- **Email Notifications**: Get notified of new submissions

### Data Export
- Export to CSV/Excel
- Download as PDF
- Share with team members
- Set up automated reports

### Security
- Only form owner can view responses
- Can share with specific people
- Data is stored securely by Google
- GDPR compliant
